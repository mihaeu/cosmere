## [Unreleased]

## [0.17.0] - 2022-11-08

### Added

-   Added capability of running Cosmere as a script library.
-   Added support for custom renderers.

### Changed

-   Local copies of attachment are no longer stored, because caching is done by comparing filename and size instead
-   `--force` now also forces re-upload of attachments

## [0.16.0] - 2022-07-12

### Changed

-   Links to markdown files that are in the cosmere.json will now be rendered as Confluence links. (closes #12)
-   Write cache even if upload is not successful. This saves time and helps with debugging.
-   Print paths relative to the config file in the log output.

## [0.15.0] - 2022-06-06

### Added

-   Added config option `personalAccessToken` and environment variable `CONFLUENCE_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` in order to support authentication using [personal access tokens](https://confluence.atlassian.com/enterprise/using-personal-access-tokens-1026032365.html). (solves [#26](https://github.com/mihaeu/cosmere/issues/26))
-   Added `--insecure` flag in order to not have to use `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0` in cases where it's needed.

### Changed

-   Pictures are now only uploaded if they differ in filename or size. Only pictures that do not match will be deleted remotely (previously all pictures were deleted, then all were uploaded).

### Fixed

-   Fixed cache check so that only real changes in files require an update.

## [0.14.1] - 2021-08-25

### Fixed

-   Fixed relative parts in attachments causing issues. Now `../../example.png` will be flattened to `___example.png`.

## [0.14.0] - 2021-03-05

### Added

-   Support for rendering `<details>` blocks [as Confluence expand macros](https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/expand-macro-223222352.html)
